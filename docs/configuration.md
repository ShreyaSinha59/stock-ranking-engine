# Configuration & Environment Management (Phase 1.1.4)

All configurable parameters must be externalized and version-controlled.
Code must not contain environment-specific logic or hardcoded values.

The system supports explicit environments (local, production) with identical logic and differing configuration.

All changes to parameters, thresholds, and weights must be committed and traceable.
